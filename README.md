# peakd_main
Repo for all docs related to Peakd app / website

# This repo contains all our files for Peakd. We will build, test, and edit each other's work here.

### Things we want to do on this site - Throw your name on something if you want to lead the project!
* Build Home Page
* Determine good data sources and wrangle that data into useable content (Jon)
* Build a strong community platform - It should be able to email, text, Messenger, etc.
* Build app
* Take in user data (Jon)
* Make an Instagram Account & Facebook Page
* Make a logo, determine color schemes, etc. (Ryan)

### Files - this can be deleted as the file count becomes unmanageable
* peakd_html is the first HTML file for the site
* peakd_css contains the CSS
* peaked_js contains our JavaScript and related libraries
* peaked_py contains Jon's experimental Python files that will be used to gather data from various sources
